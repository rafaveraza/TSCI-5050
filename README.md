# TSCI-5050
Course: TSCI 5050, Introduction to Data Science

Feel free to edit our [course wiki](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/TSCI-5050/wiki) as you wish. 

Still waiting for four people to [vote on a morning or afternoon](http://doodle.com/poll/sk3gqyckk6c3hq6k) on which to have session 5, Statistics Crash Course, Part 1.

## Session 02: R, Anatomy of a Programming Language
[Homework 02, due by Session 03](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/TSCI-5050/raw/master/TSCI5050_HW02.doc)

## Session 01: Introduction

Do your best, try each of the problems and come back to them after the reading if you can't answer them on the first try. Try to sync it to your GitHub repository a couple of times before you're done with it, so I know what I need to cover during the upcoming session. The [GitHub Desktop Tutorial](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/TSCI-5050/raw/master/GitHub Desktop Tutorial - LSMM.pptx) will help you sync your files, and the [R Anatomy cheatsheet](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/TSCI-5050/raw/master/R Anatomy.doc) may be helpful in reviewing your answers. But, it's not just about R... it's about what questions to ask when you're trying to figure out a new programming language. As an example of the same analysis applied to a different language, I'm also posting a [Python Anatomy cheatsheet](https://github.com/UTHSCSA-CIRD/TSCI-5050/raw/master/Python Anatomy.doc).
