# Part 1: Visualization in R Using ggplot2
We will be using a package called `ggplot2`, which should already come pre-installed with your RStudio/R instances, but if not, you can get it from RStudio with `install.packages('ggplot2')`. `ggplot2` allows you to build up plots in a modular manner, making it easier (once you understand how it works) to quickly create new plots and modify existing ones.

The main components of a `ggplot2` are:

* Data: what you are trying to visualize
* Aesthetic Mapping: what visual attributes will represent which features of your data (will be explained in a moment, hold tight)
* Geometry: what actually gets drawn on your plot
* Scales: modifying the default settings that various aesthetics use (will be explained in a moment, hold tight)
* Facets: how a single plot should get broken up into multiple plots to make it easier to understand
* Themes: how to change global default values of your plot
* Labels: where/how to write text and what the text should say
* Statistics: how your data is transformed when it is plotted (not all plots will use this)

## The `ggplot()` function
There are several plotting functions in `ggplot2`, but we will focus on the generic one called `ggplot()`. It is the "bottom" layer that can take a `data` argument which specifies a `data.frame` and a `mapping` argument which specifies output from an `aes()` function. Like this:
```{r}
library(ggplot2);
mygg <- ggplot(data=rawdeid.sam,aes(x=AGE,y=Y));
```

What the above code says amounts to: "bundle up my data, `rawdeid.sam`, together an abstract rule saying that in whatever way we end up plotting this data, the x-axis will represent age and the y-axis will represent the `Y` variable from sessions 5 and 6".

## The geometry functions
But the `mygg` object we created is not by itself going to be plot-able. We specified the x and y axes, but we have not yet said what type of plot we want. For this we need one or more geometries. Like this:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Scatter plot
mygg + geom_point();
```

Or this:
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Smoothed line plot
mygg + geom_smooth();
```

Notice you don't actually use a plot command. Simply adding the output of a `geom_FOO()` to `mygg` plots the data contained in `mygg` using the `FOO` method, interpreting the x and y aesthetic mappings in some manner specific to that method. There are many geometries in `ggplot2` and you can add them to the same underlying `ggplot` object...
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
mygg + geom_bin2d();
mygg + geom_line();
mygg + geom_quantile();
mygg + geom_density2d();
```

Not every geometry looks good or makes sense for every dataset...
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_area();
mygg + geom_boxplot();
mygg + geom_violin();
mygg + geom_step();
mygg + geom_dotplot();
mygg + geom_polygon();
```

It's up to you to decide which geometries are most appropriate to your data. Many of them require additional arguments to the `aes()` function. Still, it's pretty convenient that `ggplot2` is smart enough to do something reasonable when you type `mygg + geom_point()` without having to specify any additional arguments. You can add multiple geometries to the same `ggplot` object:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_density2d();
mygg + geom_density2d() + geom_point(shape='.');
mygg + geom_density2d() + geom_point(shape='.') + geom_smooth();
```

## More Aesthetic Mappings
In the above example, we use two arguments to the `aes()` command: `x` and `y`, for two of the ways a plot is capable of communicating meaning. Here are some other possible arguments (different geometries may use the same argument in different ways, and some geometries ignore some arguments).

* `color` (line or outline color)
* `fill` (internal color, where applicable)
* shape (shape of points, where applicable)
* linetype (dotted, dashed, etc. where applicable)
* size (size of points or thickness of lines)
* alpha (transparency-- the closer to 0, the more transparent)

Let's try color...
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg <- ggplot(data=rawdeid.sam,aes(x=AGE,y=Y,color=SEX));
mygg + geom_point();
```

But we don't have to re-create `mygg` each time. The `geom_FOO()` functions can take an optional `aes()` argument which overrides any existing mappings from the baseline one, adds any new ones and keeps the rest. So the below gives the same plot:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg <- ggplot(data=rawdeid.sam,aes(x=AGE,y=Y));
mygg + geom_point(aes(color=SEX));
```

Now let's try shape.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_point(aes(shape=SEX));
```

Size.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_point(aes(size=SEX));
```

Um no. How about alpha?
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_point(aes(alpha=SEX));
```

That might be useful for emphasizing one group and then the other, in turn.

Let's try linetype.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_point(aes(linetype=SEX));
```

Doesn't seem to do anything... because `geom_point()` doesn't plot any lines, so it ignores the `linetype` argument. So let's try something that does plot lines...
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_density2d(aes(linetype=SEX));
```

This could be useful in some scenarios. We can better differentiate the two groups by using multiple aesthetic mappings.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_density2d(aes(linetype=SEX,color=SEX));
```

Or we can simultaneously distinguish multiple variables with a different aesthetic mapping for each.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_point(aes(color=BMI_BIN,shape=SEX));
```

## Representing a series of observations
As we discussed in sessions 5 and 6, these data points represent many visits from a smaller number of patients. So a scatter plot omits important information: which visits are linked to a single patient. A line-plot doesn't do the trick either, because it joins _all_ the points within a group into single line (except for where it skips missing observations)...
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(color=SEX));
```

We could join them by `PATIENT_NUM` but then it looks like Rainbow Dash threw up on your screen.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(color=factor(PATIENT_NUM)));
```

Which points are joined by a line can be directly specified by an `aes()` argument called `group` as follows:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM));
```

This frees up `color` so we can again use it to indicate some other property of the data.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX));
```

It would have taken a lot of web searching and inference to figure out on your own how to plot time series from many individuals on the same axis... and now you know!

## Scales
Let's say you don't want the default brick-red and turquoise colors for your lines. You can override them by adding on a scale function.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(m='red',f='darkgreen'));
```


Most of the `aes()` arguments have corresponding `scale_FOO_BAR()` functions, often several to choose from. Including ones for numeric variables, such as the `x` axis in our example. You can override the default linear scale of the `x` axis and put it on the log scale.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX)) + 
  scale_x_log10();
```

You can also use `scale_FOO_BAR()` functions to specify attributes such as `limits`, `breaks`, and `name` of the scale (here we are back to using the default `scale_x_continuous()` but these arguments work with many types of scales).
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days'
                     ,limits=c(20,80)
                     ,breaks=seq(0,100,by=20));
```

The same scales exist for the `y` argument to `aes()`. But you don't have to use them all. Often you might use a scale function just to change the label, and leave everything else at its default value.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response')
```

## Facets
You may remember from sessions 5 and 6 that a specific combination of sex and race exhibited a differential treatment effect. Now, we could visualize this using some combination of `color`, `linetype`, `size`, `alpha`, and maybe even add on top of the `geom_line()` a `geom_point()` and thus enable the use of `shape`. But the plot starts to get busy. Instead of doing that, you can use one of the variables break it out into a set of plots that use the same axes using the `facet_wrap()` function. 
```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Break them out by race...
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE);
# Or by sex
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=RACE),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~SEX);
```

### Constant Aesthetic Mappings
You may have noticed that in the above plot we have `alpha=0.7` instead of having it be determined by one of the variables. Earlier we similarly had a plot where we used `geom_point(shape='.')`.  This means that the opacity of all the lines is 70%, or in the other example, the shape of all the points is `.`, regardless of what values the variables are. These constant aesthetic mappings are set by arguments _outside_ `aes()` function whereas the data-dependent aesthetic mappings are set by arguments _inside_ `aes()`. Compare...

```{r,warning=FALSE,fig.width=3,fig.height=3,fig.show='hold'}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX));
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM),color='indianred2');
```

## Themes
What if you don't like the default gray background with white gridlines? You can change it using themes.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
# Black & White
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_bw();
# Minimal
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_minimal();
# Light
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_light();
# Classic
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_classic();
# Linedraw
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_linedraw();
```

You can then fine-tune the defaults for a particular theme using the `theme()` function.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name='Age in Days') +
  scale_y_continuous(name='Response') +
  facet_wrap(~RACE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
  plot.background=element_rect(fill = 'gray')
  ,panel.background=element_rect(fill='white')
  ,text=element_text(colour = 'white',face = 'bold'));
```


## Labels
We don't have to invoke, for example, `scale_x_continuous()` just to change the name of the axis. We can use the `labs()` function instead.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
mygg + geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~RACE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(x='Age in Days',y='Response',legend='Sex',title='Response vs. Age')
```

## Statistics
As a finishing touch, we can visually summarize the raw data by using the `stat_FOO()` functions.
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Bounding Ellipses
mygg + 
  geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~RACE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(x='Age in Days'
       ,y='Response'
       ,legend='Sex'
       ,title='Response vs. Age') +
  stat_ellipse(aes(group=SEX,color=SEX));  

# Or Smoothed Curves
mygg + 
  geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX),alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~RACE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(x='Age in Days'
       ,y='Response'
       ,legend='Sex'
       ,title='Response vs. Age') +
  stat_smooth(aes(group=SEX,color=SEX));  
```

By the way, remember how `x` is an `aes()` variable? What if we override it inside of `geom_line()` and `stat_smooth`? Will that work? Let's find out.
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
mygg + 
  geom_line(aes(group=PATIENT_NUM,color=SEX,x=BMI),alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_wrap(~RACE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(x='BMI'
       ,y='Response'
       ,legend='Sex'
       ,title='Response vs. BMI') +
  stat_smooth(aes(group=SEX,color=SEX,x=BMI));  

```

So here, in one plot is the visual accompaniment of the statistical story that unfolded in sessions 5 and 6.

## More Information
There is a lot more to `ggplot2` than we covered here, but hopefully this will give you a starting point from which to expand your skills. Here are sources of helpful information about `ggplot2`, with examples:

* http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/ (the author's website)
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2
* https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf

## Challenge: find someone who thinks it's a good idea to spend $1000/seat on MS Tableau and see how long it will take them to reproduce the above results.

# Part 2: Clustering and Decision Trees

## Why?

* When there are many variables to choose from, finding the ones that are most relevant to the outcome of interest.
* Better understanding at a high level which groups of observations are similar to each other.

## Clustering
Let's add some noise to our data, and see if we can separate out the relevant variables from the rest.

```{r}
rawdeid.sam$VAR01<-rnorm(nrow(rawdeid.sam),mean = 5,sd=2.5)
rawdeid.sam$VAR02<-rlnorm(nrow(rawdeid.sam),mean = 2.5,sd=1.2)
rawdeid.sam$VAR03<-rchisq(nrow(rawdeid.sam), df=2, ncp = 3)
```

### Correlation Matrix
Which variables correlate with which other variables? Let's create a correlation matrix. 
```{r}
 rawdeid.cor <- cor(data.matrix(rawdeid.sam),use = 'pairwise');
```

And now let's create a convenient color-generating function to use in the next several examples.
```{r}
colorfun <- colorRamp(c("#CC0000","white","#3366CC"), space="Lab");
```

### Default Heatmap in R
Here we use our color function. Blue means correlation red means inverse correlation.
```{r}
heatmap(rawdeid.cor,symm = TRUE
        ,col = rgb(colorfun((rawdeid.cor+1)/2),maxColorValue = 255));
```

### Plotting Correlations with `plotcorr`
Here is another way to visualize correlation. For this we will need the `ellipse` library.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
#install.packages('ellipse'); 
library(ellipse);
plotcorr(rawdeid.cor, col=rgb(colorfun((rawdeid.cor+1)/2), maxColorValue=255));
```

### K-Means Clustering
The idea behind K-means is to optimally divide the data into K clusters. A good library for doing this is `fpc`.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
#install.packages('fpc'); 
library(fpc);
deidk <- pamk(data.matrix(rawdeid.sam)
              ,krange=2:5,usepam = F,scaling = T,critout = T);
deidk$nc;
plot(deidk$pamobject);
```



## Decision Trees

To be continued!
